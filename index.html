        <p id="p1">My favorite hobby is programming. There are many things that make it enjoyable. You get to program and build a software that can help others, and later be resting assured that somebody's life will be changed forever with the help of your app. And since coding and software development is the next generation, it is crucial to understand coding and become a fully-fledged computer engineer at a young age. Programming teaches us many significant life skills as well. Coding also allows you to be creative and think in algorithims. Being successful at coding means you have a good chance of being succesful at life. </p>

        <p>Hi! I am a coding student at White Hat Jr, and I love to program! I gain inspiration from my idols and work to be like them. I will not reveal any more information about myself. But here is a webpage I have created in the IDE tool Codepen.io. It informs you all about span and div tags in html, and uses the window.alert function in JavaScript to display if or if not an object is a span or div element. I also use the audio tag in html to play an audio when a div element is clicked. I hope you enjoy it!
